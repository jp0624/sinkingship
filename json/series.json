We follow the unpredictable and real preschool adventures of seven new charismatic kids aged three to six. From having fun belting out songs to dealing with real-life issues like the death of the classroom goldfish and going to the dentist, each episode takes kids and parents at home into the unscripted world of preschoolers. The enchanting bright coral reef cave and blue ‘water’ streamers reflect the season’s ocean theme and the seal puppet, Blue, replaces Moxey, the much-loved monkey puppet from \u003ci\u003eThe Jungle Room\u003c/i\u003e. Special deliveries arrive via treasure chest and fun guests – ranging from fire-fighters to magicians – visit in each episode to introduce the kids to something new. Teacher Anthony returns to help his young friends learn, live and get along."
